# Walbrek the Fourth

> [!NOTE]
> This is the backstory of a D&D character I'm working for a new campaign, inspired by my love of mockumentaries, 4th wall gags, comedy shows and movies. I put it on Github to record it, but feedback is welcome :)

Walbrek was a sheltered child growing up. Her parents wanted her to become a scholar, just like them, and they held a tight and brutal control over her life in pursuit of that mission. She followed a strict schedule from the second she could walk, with most of her time devoted to education. There was no time allotted for play or amusement because to them, it served no purpose.

At school, her schoolmates became friends, formed lasting bonds and had lots of fun. Walbrek spent her time alone, in the library, rote memorizing facts. While her cousins were playing games and chasing each other in the yard, she spent her time at her father’s side having intellectual debates with the adults, going toe-to-toe with scholars who were three times her age. Walbrek aced every test that was ever put in front of her. She even reminded teachers to schedule tests for the class.

To the unseeing eye, Walbrek was a prodigy: a true testament to what can be achieved with unwavering focus and discipline.

Unfortunately, Walbrek was also a terrible template for success. She was a giant people-pleaser, spending all her energy trying to make her parents happy. She was helplessly dependent on others to determine the course of her life. She was incapable of being still and was oblivious of her surroundings. She was boastful, had no friends and lacked all the fun experiences of childhood. Instead, she saw the world with the eyes of an adult: black and white, serious, pessimistic and humorless; all before she turned 18\.

With no surprise, Walbrek graduated from her school with top grades and was due to attend a free-ride scholarship to Augustus Institute next year, under the tutelage of the renowned scholar Jack Black.

So very proud of their child they were, that her parents had their first moment of weakness in 18 years and gave Walbrek the whole year off to do whatever she wanted and “find herself” before she went right back to the grind.

Little did they know, this choice would be the end of the bright future they had meticulously planned for their daughter.

For the first time in her miserable life, Walbrek had no immediate goal. It took her all of 3 hours to become incredibly bored and indecisive about how to spend the rest of the year.

Frustrated with having to wait a whole year, she sought out her future tutor, Jack Black to get a head start on her education.

Jack Black was all too familiar with prodigies. He had had several under his tutelage and found that they were unbearably eager and precocious. Walbrek was no different and Jack intended to curb her enthusiasm.

He instructed Walbrek to travel to a distant temple of Selune and seek out the priestess Gwyneth, who would teach Walbrek the secrets of meditation and enlightenment.

Filled to the brim with purpose, Walbrek embarked on her journey to the temple. When she arrived, the priestess met her at the gates to explain the rules of the temple. Patrons who enter must demonstrate their journey to enlightenment through action and not through words. Out of respect to Selune, any who enter the temple must take a vow of silence while within its hallowed walls.

Walbrek made the vow and was offered one of the bare rooms within the temple. The next day, she began practicing meditation with the priestess.

Meditation proved particularly difficult for Walbrek, because it involved doing nothing for a long time, something she was quite terrible at. However, like all the challenges she had previously conquered, she believed she would be ahead of schedule on this one too.

And indeed, after 3 months of continuous practice, she did the impossible. She became still. She silenced the voice in her head. She began to listen.

… and she realized that somebody was definitely speaking inside the temple.

She began noticing it during her meditations when she was deeply focused. Murmurs of quiet voices. Random words. Shushes. Laughter … and even … applause?

She couldn’t make any sense of it. The other patrons took their vows very seriously, so it couldn’t be any of them. Besides, there weren’t enough people in the room for the number of voices she could hear.

Having mastered the art of meditation, she started to apply her newfound skill on the voices, focusing in on exactly what was being said.

She found it best to do this at night, when she heard the most words being spoken.

”… her origin story …”

”… great casting …”

“… last episode …”

It took her another month to start picking out entire sentences.

”Ohmygod, Tiffany. You totally need to start watching. Walbrek is like, a total mood.”

They were talking … about her. Who were these people? What did they want?

“Becky, right now she’s just like … on her journey. But you just wait. She’ll turn into a total girlboss and … I … am … here for it”

After another month of practice, the sounds were crystal clear and took no effort for her to hear. So she set her mind onto figuring out who these people were and what they wanted.

She made some important observations.

* Whoever these people were, they were watching her during the day and then talking about her at night. Every day was an “episode”.  
* There was nowhere in the temple where she could hide from them.  
* Nobody else in the temple could hear them. Or they were incredibly good at hiding it, which Walbrek thought was unlikely.  
* As omnipresent as they were, they couldn’t hear her thoughts.  
* She could only hear them talk about her life. Otherwise they stayed silent.  
* The voices were directional. They seemed to emanate from random spots in the area around her.  
* The voices seemed to be roused by good entertainment.

One day, Walbrek was sprinting up the steps of the temple to get to the daily prayer, when she tripped. Somewhere to her right, she heard several loud gasps.

Another time, she stubbed her toe on the fireplace and hopped around the room in a furious, but completely silent tantrum. That time, she heard laughter and giggles.

When she read her parent’s obituary, she heard sobs two feet in front of her.

It happened during the seventh month of her stay at the temple. An earthquake had struck the village and her parent’s house collapsed while they were inside.

Her cousins sent letters begging her to return and attend the funeral, but her sense of duty kept her bound to the temple. Besides, her parents had taught her to not get caught up in feelings, because it was more important to keep moving on. Shedding tears was pointless, so she didn’t. The voices had done plenty of that on her behalf.

They also had a lot to say that night.

“Well that episode sucked. Why isn't she going to the funeral?”

“The writers say they have big plans for her arc.”

“Mark my words, this will be important for her story later on. It always is.”

“She’s a strong girl. She’ll pull through.”

”I just want to hug her\! She must feel so alone and aimless right now.”

Until those words were said, Walbrek didn’t realize exactly how aimless her life had now become. Her parents were everything to her. They showed her the path and she walked it. That’s how it always was. Without them … who would do that for her?

Sure, she could just go to Augustus Institute, like planned. But then what?

This question was too much for her to contemplate. She spent the next month thoughtlessly listening to the voices, who were feeling sorry for her.

In the tenth month, the voices started getting excited about Walbrek’s departure. They were theorizing what she would do next.

“If I were her, I would just totally reinvent my life. Maybe work as a barkeep somewhere”

”I think it would be really cool if she started working out and became one of those strong silent warrior princess types.”

”She would make a lot of money at Sharess’ Caress”

And then it hit her. She was looking for direction. The voices were giving it to her.

She tested out her theory by doing some light exercise the next day. She tried doing push-ups and planks in the morning and a light jog in the afternoon.

The results were instantaneous.

”OH MY GOD\! I called it. I totally called it\!”

”I’m glad she’s focusing on her health. This is just what she needs. Her life is like a hellscape right now.”

”If I were her, I’d totally change up my look to match my new physique.”

”That would be such a good twist\!”

The next day, Walbrek went bald. The voices applauded.

The connection between Walbrek and the voices became so strong that she began to sense their presence. In a room, she could pinpoint exactly where they were watching her from.

Once, she waved at them and they totally lost it.

”Aieeeee, did you see how she waved at us today? I love her so much\!”

Slowly, but surely, the voices were influencing Walbrek in ways they had never done before. When they laughed, she found herself smiling. When they gave encouragement, she found the strength to push herself further. When they said they loved her, she felt her chest swell with pride.

They became her friends. Her companions. Her surrogate parents.

On her last day at the temple, Walbrek was concerned. The voices were whispering in quiet anticipation. They wanted her to leave, but she had a scary thought.

What if the voices were somehow connected to the temple? Who would tell her what to do if she left?

She decided to test it out. In the worst case, she’d turn around the next day and come back to the temple. She refused to be alone in the world anymore.

The voices were silent as she exited the gates.

She heard nothing as she walked a kilometre down the hill and across the river.

In the wide open environment around her, it was hard to pinpoint where the voices were, if they were there at all.

She stopped near the entrance to the forest and listened with bated breath.

…

”Wait, why did she stop?”

”BRENDA, SHUT UP\!”

Walbrek grinned and entered the forest.

Remaining story: 

* She does actually return to the institute, but to learn acting and performance skills.  
* She gets feedback about the day from her audience. They can be hyper critical or ecstatic or kinda mid.  
* She practices lines at night so she can use them during the day.  
* The show seems to be focused on her and her adventures. It has elements of comedy, romance and action in it.  
* When her audience  gets bored, she has to get inventive and desperate to keep them happy.  
* In a fight for her life, the audience is quiet, so she can focus on staying alive.  
* Whenever she performs, she prefers to focus on her invisible audience instead of the real people in the room.  
* The audience is definitely not a voice in her head, but she lets people think she's a kook who talks to imaginary people cause she doesn't want to risk losing her audience or sharing the limelight.  
* She runs multiple 4th wall breaking gags: talking to camera, side glances, motioning at camera. She tries to be stealthy about it. If caught and questioned about it, she plays dumb.  
* The “camera” can move and shift dynamically to get the best shot. She does not worry about where the camera is unless it's for a 4th wall gag.  
* She may choose to be a little extra dramatic and play up mundane situations to keep things spicy.  
* She's a little preoccupied at night trying to figure out what her audience wants to see.  
* It's completely unknown who the audience is. There is an official “crew” of writers and producers that get referenced by the viewers. We don't know who they are.  
* She and everybody else are assumed to be actors.
